      <p class="bio">
        I recently completed my internship at Amazon Robotics, where I designed and built a scalable GenAI-powered chatbot integrated with AWS services to improve incident response. Previously, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Goldman Sachs on cloud migration, reliability engineering, and API security. I enjoy building secure, data-driven solutions that enhance performance, reliability, and user experience.
